# Programming-Theory-Repo
My most complex project, OOP realized. Submission 2 for jr programmer pathway
The final project was made for Unity Learn final submission. 
OOP pillars are realized in the code of the project. 
The game prototype is about fighting zombies and taking resources to the base. 
Watch "how to play screen" for more info. 
I can't say what gameplay is very interesting, but for me, this project is a great step in learning and development. 
I like this project because in the future It can be upgraded with a quest system, or with transitions 
inside the locations (scenes with top-down or FPS gameplay need to be added). 
The Player's village upgrade system can be added. There are a lot of ideas for the future use of this prototype!
